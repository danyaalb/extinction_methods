# extinction_methods

Hi! This folder has the methods created for my attempt at making a new package. I made a version that will take in a region file (.reg) and use that as a mask on the file used. For a very detailed description on the method itself see Lipman et. al 2024 (should be on archive). We can then find the relative distances of molecular clouds and find the best fit parabola (representing the X-ray lightcurve) from these distances.
